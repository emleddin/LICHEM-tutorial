LICHEM (Layered Interacting CHEmical Models) is an open-source package for
interfacing between software for quantum mechanics (QM) and molecular
mechanics (MM), enabling QM/MM calculations to make use of polarizable,
frozen electron density, and point-charge force fields.

The LICHEM code is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/CisnerosResearch/LICHEM).

## About QM/MM

Eventually, I will talk about the theory behind QM/MM here.

## About the Pseudobond Approach

Eventually, I will talk about the pseudobond stuff here.

## Selecting a QM Region

Eventually, I will talk about how to select a QM region here.
